            <p>Welcome to <strong>MoodScape</strong>, my digital diary project designed to support mental well-being by offering features like mood, habit and goal tracking. This Privacy Policy outlines how I collect, use, protect, and handle your information when you use the application.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">1. Information I Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Username, Email, and Password:</strong> When you register for MoodScape, I collect your chosen username, email address, and a hashed version of your password. Your real name is not required.</p>
            <p><strong>Mood, Well-being, and Goal Data:</strong> You can input data related to your mood, habits, and goals. Additionally, you can provide text entries for mood tracking, which includes sentiment analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Data:</strong> I may collect technical data related to your use of MoodScape, such as login data and other engagement metrics. The specifics of this data collection will depend on the hosting solution and technologies used once the project is deployed.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used to provide and improve MoodScape's services, including personalizing your experience, enabling detailed mood tracking and sentiment analysis, and communicating with you about your account or any changes to the services.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>I may share your information with third parties for the purpose of providing the service, specifically for mood tracking and sentiment analysis. The analysis is conducted as part of the mood tracking feature, leveraging technologies like DistilBERT and OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide you with insights and personalized suggestions.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>As MoodScape is currently a project in development, I am in the process of evaluating and will implement appropriate security measures to protect your information once hosted on a third-party service.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">5. Your Rights Over Your Data</h2>
            <p>You have the ability to edit or delete your mood entries, goal tracking data, and any other personal information at any time. If you choose to delete your data, it will be permanently removed from our database.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated at my discretion. However, as this project is part of an academic assignment, major changes are not anticipated.</p>
